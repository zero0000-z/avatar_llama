The video ends with the isopetra die remaining stationary and not moving.\n\nOverall, the video shows the isopetra die's inability to navigate and move in the absence of visual stimuli, highlighting the importance of light and vision in the life of this insect.",

The front legs are used to propel the insect forward, while the hind legs provide stability and support. The insect moves its front legs in a slow, deliberate manner, taking small steps as it navigates the surface.

At 0.4 seconds, the ant suddenly drops the cotton and begins to frantically wave its antennae in the air. It then picks up the cotton again and continues to crawl. At 0.7 seconds, the ant stops and looks around, as if it is searching for something. It then begins to crawl again, carrying the cotton with it. At 1.1 seconds, the ant encounters an obstacle and must use its antennae to push itself over it. It continues to crawl until it reaches the edge of the frame at 1.9 seconds.\n\nOverall, the video shows an ant performing a series of movements as it carries a small piece of cotton on its back.
